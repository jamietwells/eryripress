<p>Knowing whether a person normally votes at elections is a powerful piece of information for your campaign.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to transfer your marked registers to the electoral database. We can help!</p>
<p>The marked register is a copy of the electoral register that was used on Polling Day, showing who turned out to vote. Copies of the marked register are available for one year after the election.</p>
<p>Eryri is working with local parties to make sure you don’t miss out on this valuable data.</p>
<p>Has your local party purchased your marked registers already but no one knows how to upload the data? Or would you like us to purchase the files for you?</p>
<div class="pricing">
<p><strong>The cost of this service for a single parliamentary constituency or local authority area is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>£385 standard charge,</li>
<li>Less £100 if you have already purchased the marked registers (in data/PDF form),</li>
<li>As ever, all prices shown include VAT. To enquire, simply complete the below form.</li>
</ul>
<p>These price points can be adjusted <i>pro rata</i> for local authorities that are significantly larger than the average Westminster constituency.</p>

<p>We use the latest optical character recognition software to do this smoothly - but don't worry, all the data is verified by a human being!</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Q. How accurate is the software?</b></dt>
<dd>A. Provided the files are of a high enough quality, the software we use is about 99% accurate. This is as accurate as any volunteer – and so much quicker!</dd>
<dt><b>Q. What causes failure?</b></dt>
            <dd>A. The biggest problem we face when it comes to using the software is poor quality PDF files
                from the local authority. If you are requesting the files, please specify that the scanned
                pages must be of the highest possible quality to ensure that the OCR software can read them.</dd>
<dt><b>Q. What about postal and proxy voters?</b></dt>
            <dd>A. These are included free of charge, but it is most helpful if your council provides the
                absent voter marked register in Excel/CSV format rather than a PDF.</dd>
