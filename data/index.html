        <p>Knowing whether a person normally votes at elections is a powerful piece of information for your campaign.
        </p>
        <p>To do this, you need to transfer your marked registers to the electoral database. We can help!</p>
        <p>The marked register is a copy of the electoral register that was used on Polling Day, showing who turned out
            to
            vote. Copies of the marked register are available for one year after the election.</p>
        <p>Eryri is working with local parties to make sure you don’t miss out on this valuable data.</p>
        <p>Has your local party purchased your marked registers already but no one knows how to upload the data? Or
            would
            you like us to purchase the files for you?</p>
        <div class="pricing">
            <p><strong>The cost of this service for a single parliamentary constituency or local authority area
                    is:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>£385 standard charge,</li>
                <li>Less £100 if you have already purchased the marked registers (in data/PDF form),</li>
                <li>All prices shown include VAT.</li>
                <li>These costs are adjusted <i>pro rata</i> if you require the registers for an entire local authority that is significantly larger
                than the average Westminster constituency.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b><span class="drop-cap">Q.</span> How does this service ensure the integrity of electoral data, and comply with the GDPR?</b></dt>
        <dd>All data is anonymised - there will never be any need for the exchange of name or address information between the Parties. The customer is asked to provide a password-protected Excel file listing polling districts, elector numbers and a unique "key" (numerical code) against each record. We then return two lists showing only the unique codes - one for 'on the day' voters and one for absent (postal/proxy) voters.
            <p>We can provide remote support at every stage to help you upload the completed data to your party's database. Please consult our <a href="https://eryripress.co.uk/privacy/">privacy policy</a> for more information about how we comply with data protection law.</dd></p>

        <dt><b><span class="drop-cap">Q.</span> How accurate is the software?</b></dt>
        <dd>Provided the files are of a high enough quality, the software we use is about 99% accurate. This is as accurate as any volunteer – and so much quicker!</dd>

        <dt><b><span class="drop-cap">Q.</span> What causes failure?</b></dt>
        <dd>The biggest problem we encounter when it comes to using the software is poor quality PDF files from the local authority. If you are requesting the files, please specify that the scanned pages must be of the highest possible quality to ensure that the OCR software can read them.</dd>

        <dt><b><span class="drop-cap">Q.</span> What about postal and proxy voters?</b></dt>
        <dd>These are included as part of the service, but it is helpful if your council provides the absent voter marked register in Excel/CSV format rather than a PDF.</dd>
