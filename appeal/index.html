    <h2>Appeal a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN)</h2>

    <p>If you have received a penalty charge notice (PCN) and want to appeal, you need to do this within <strong>28 days</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you make your appeal within <strong>14 days</strong> of the date of the PCN, then the discount rate will be re-offered if your appeal is unsuccessful.</p>

    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      <p><strong>Send your appeal by email - quoting your PCN number (beginning AW) - to:</strong> 
        <a href="mailto:appeals@gmcaparking.co.uk" class="govuk-link">appeals@gmcaparking.co.uk</a>
      </p>
      <p>We are unable to advise on appeals or process them over the phone.</p>
      <p><em>Please note:</em> a penalty may take up to 24 working hours to appear on our online system.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Make an appeal</h3>
    <p>If your appeal has been rejected and you still want to appeal, then you must wait for the <strong>Notice to Owner (NtO)</strong> to make your next appeal.</p>

    <h3>Notice to Owner (NtO)</h3>
    <p>When you receive the NtO in the post you have two options available. You can make the payment or you can make a representation.</p>
    <p>You need to make your representation within <strong>28 days</strong> of receiving the letter. We will look at your reasons and write to you with our decision.</p>

    <h3>Notice of Rejection (NoR)</h3>
    <p>You will receive a NoR if your representation against the NtO is unsuccessful. You still have the option of appealing; this must be made to the <strong>Traffic Penalty Tribunal (TPT)</strong> within 28 days of the NoR.</p>
    <p>They are separate from ourselves and will look at your next appeal independently.</p>

    <h3>Charge Certificate</h3>
    <p>If you have received a Charge Certificate you can no longer appeal the charge. You can pay at the current rate or you can wait for the <strong>Order of Recovery (OfR)</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Order of Recovery</h3>
    <p>When you receive the OfR you can no longer appeal the charge. You can pay at the current rate or you can make a <strong>witness statement</strong> to the Traffic Enforcement Centre (TEC).</p>
    <p>You can make a witness statement to the TEC based on four grounds:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>You did not receive the PCN or NtO</li>
      <li>You made representations to us but did not receive a response</li>
      <li>You made an appeal to TPT but did not receive a response</li>
      <li>You paid the PCN</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enforcement agents (bailiffs)</h3>
    <p>If your PCN has been sent to enforcement agents, then you need to speak to them or contact the TEC as described above.</p>
